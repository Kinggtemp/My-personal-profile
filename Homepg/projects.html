                            <h2> Genius Inspired Project</h2>
                            <p style="font-size: small;">This was my first ever attempt at building my own website. I
                                wanted
                                to create multiple pages based on
                                'Genius', I figured if i can work out links, images and audio then I will have a strong
                                foundation to work from.
                                I am happy with this even tho it is not a perfect website or looks amazing, it is good
                                for
                                me to experiment and learn more as time goes on.
                                I tried to add a lot of variety to show different skills and I guess for myself to learn
                                different things.
                                I started on this webpage and decided to expand on this and create a navigation bar so I
                                can
                                put all my projects in one place.</p>

                        <h2> Calculator Project </h2>
                        <p>This is a mini project that I wanted to complete as it a starter Javascript project.
                            I think it is amazing that we can code computors into solving our problems and work out
                            equations
                            for us in a second. This isn't a complex project but I am happy with this.

                <h2> Javascript Login Form</h2>
                <p>This was my first attempt at using Javascript in a creative way to add a mordern element to sign up/sign in pages,
                    this also was my first small project to show employers that I can help produce/reinvent work for their buisness.
                It isnt a lot but all buisnesses need a way to have customers make accounts to keep them coming back to their website, received via email. </p>
