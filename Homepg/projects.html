                        <h2> Genius Inspired Project</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: small;">This was my first ever attempt at building my own website. I wanted
                            to create multiple pages based on
                            'Genius', I figured if i can work out links, images and audio then I will have a strong
                            foundation to work from.
                            I am happy with this even tho it is not a perfect website or looks amazing, it is good for
                            me to experiment and learn more as time goes on.
                            I tried to add a lot of variety to show different skills and I guess for myself to learn
                            different things.
                            I started on this webpage and decided to expand on this and create a navigation bar so I can
                            put all my projects in one place.</p>

                        <h2> Calculator Project </h2>
                        <p>This is a mini project that I wanted to complete as it a starter Javascript project.
                        I think it is amazing that we can code computors into solving our problems and work out equations
                        for us in a second. This isn't a complex project but I am happy with this.

                        <h2> First Guided Login Form</h2>
                        <p>This was my first guided walkthough of a sign-in/create an account page.
                            Although this is very good, I was following a guide as it was my first time so I can't take any credit.
                            Even though I can't take all the credit, I feel like I learnt more about some JavaScript and it shown me how good I can design 
                            websites using CSS. </p>
